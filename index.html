        Over the last year, Cameron has been working on an NFC/RFID 
        reader for his school cafeteria. <br><br>
        At the beginning of the 2023-2024 school year, he questioned why this 
        system wasn't already implemented and that is when this project kicked off. <br><br>
        As he was working on this project in his free time, he noticed that the
        the sensor he purchased was not high enough quality, so it only worked
        half the time. <br><br>
        Once the new sensor was purchased it was a lot more consistent, but there
        were still a ton of wires. He tried to tape these wires in different ways,
        but it was still really really hard to keep them in place (especially 
        if they are shaken or bumped).<br><br>
        After doing some more research, there was a version that sits on top of 
        the arduino seamlessly, eliminating all of the wires needed. <br><br>
        Once the board was all soldered, he assembled the device in a laser cut
        box, and began coding both the arduino code, and the code for the app on
        the computer. <br> <br>
        After 2 months of beta testing in the LPC with a group of 25-50 with RFID
        cards, he was able to have the cards ordered for the upcoming year. <br><br>
        The day before school he worked from 8:30 AM to 4:00 PM encoding every
        student and faculty card with data. <br><br>
        Now, we have a fully functional RFID system, and he hopes to add apple
        pay and google wallet cards, to improve ease of access with students.
